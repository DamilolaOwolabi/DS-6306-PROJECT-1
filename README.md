The purpose of the project is to analyse the International Bitterness Units and Alcohol by Volume % of different beers and breweries from different US states.

The files the data was extracted from are the "Beers.csv" and the "Breweries.csv" files

I plan to visualize and anlyse our data using various data science tools like file manipulation, string manipulation, ggplots, knn classifications, 2 sample ttests, etc.

A codebook is provided to describe in detail, the softwae, and languages being used. It also describes the generated dataset that were used towards analysing our data.
